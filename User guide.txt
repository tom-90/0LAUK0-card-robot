User-guide
After setting up your camera, you’ll be asked to draw 7 cards which you can keep for your self and the robot will also draw 7 cards from the discard stack. As the robot arm has (not yet) been implemented the instructor will act as the robot arm. All the instructions will be displayed in the terminal, so the instructor simply needs to perform these and not think for its self. For instance, the instructor needs to act as the robot arm at the start by drawing 7 cards and showing them to the camera. Then, players will take turn in putting a valid card on the discard stack. The robot gets the first turn. Note that the instructor who needs to act as the robot arm needs to read from the terminal to know which card to throw on the discard stack as this choice can be different depending on the current win-ratio the human player is persisting. 

In the “The current game status” text-box important information about the current game state will be displayed. You’ll be notified whose turn it currently is and will be updated about the effects of the cards that get played. The discard stack will simply display the card that is currently the top card of the discard stack in the physical game that is being played. Additionally, a question mark button is available which leads to a window explaining the usage of this product and a more detailed description of the game rules, which can be read below.

Game rules
As generally known, many people use a different set of rules when playing a game of "Pesten". Hence, we will explicitly state which rules are used for this program.
The rules:
* Playing card with rank 0, the "joker" => This is a "pestkaart", which means the next player needs to take new playing cards from the playing stack. In the case of a Joker, the next player needs to take 5 new playing cards from the playing stack.
* Playing card with rank 1, the "ace" => When this card is played, the direction of play reverses.
* Playing card with rank 2 => This is a "pestkaart", which means the next player needs to take new playing cards from the playing stack. In the case of a playing card with the rank 2, the next player needs to take 2 new playing cards from the playing stack.
* Playing card with rank 3 => There is no special rule for this card.
* Playing card with rank 4 => There is no special rule for this card.
* Playing card with rank 5 => There is no special rule for this card.
* Playing card with rank 6 => There is no special rule for this card.
* Playing card with rank 7 => "Zeven blijft kleven": the player that throws this card on the discard stack must throw another card with the same suit or rank onto the discard stack.
* Playing card with rank 8 => "acht wacht": the next player has to pass its turn and is not allowed to throw a card or draw a card. So, when playing with two players, the player who throws a playing card with rank 8 on the discard stack again gets the turn.
* Playing card with rank 10 => There is no special rule for this card.
* Playing card with rank 11, the "jack" => There is no special rule for this card.
* Playing card with rank 12, the "queen" => There is no special rule for this card.
* Playing card with rank 13, the "king" => There is no special rule for this card.

Additional game rules
* We make use of summing of "pestkaarten", which are the playing card with rank 2 and the joker. This means that when player 1 discards a joker, player 2 can (if he is in the possession of this card) discard a playing card with rank 2(or other "pestkaart") and does not need to take any cards from the playing stack. In this case player 1, if he/she does not posess any "pestkaarten" anymore, will need to take 7 new playing cards from the playing stack.
