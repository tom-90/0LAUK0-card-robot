User-guide
After setting up your camera, you’ll be asked to draw 7 cards which you can keep for your self and the robot will also draw 7 cards from the discard stack. As the robot arm has (not yet) been implemented the instructor will act as the robot arm. All the instructions will be displayed in the terminal, so the instructor simply needs to perform these and not think for its self. For instance, the instructor needs to act as the robot arm at the start by drawing 7 cards and showing them to the camera. Then, players will take turn in putting a valid card on the discard stack. The robot gets the first turn. Note that the instructor who needs to act as the robot arm needs to read from the terminal to know which card to throw on the discard stack as this choice can be different depending on the current win-ratio the human player is persisting. 

In the “The current game status” text-box important information about the current game state will be displayed. You’ll be notified whose turn it currently is and will be updated about the effects of the cards that get played. The discard stack will simply display the card that is currently the top card of the discard stack in the physical game that is being played. Additionally, a question mark button is available which leads to a window explaining the usage of this product and a more detailed description of the game rules, which can be read below.

Game rules
1.	The first card is not allowed to be a “pest” card.
So it is not allowed to be a “Joker”, an “Ace”, a rank 2, a rank 7 or a rank 8.
2.	You may put a card with the same rank (0, 1, …, 13) or same suits (diamonds, hearts, spades or clubs) on top of the previous card. If you do not have such a card or do not wish to play it, you have to pick a card from the stack.
3.	When playing a card with rank 0, the “Joker”, the next player needs to take 5 playing cards from the card stack. 
4.	When playing a card with rank 1, the “Ace”, the direction is reversed. Note, when playing with two players, this does not influence the game.
5.	When playing a card with rank 2, the next player needs to take 2 new card from the card stack. 
6.	When playing a card with rank 7, the player whose turn it is gets another turn. 
7.	When playing a card with rank 8, the next player has to skip his turn.
8.	“Joker” cards and card with rank 2 are allowed to be stacked. 
For example:
Player1: throws “Joker” card
Player2: throws another “Joker” card
Player1: throws rank 2 card
Player2: grabs (5 + 5 + 2 =) 12 cards 
9.	If you had to grab cards because of a “pest” card, then after you have grabbed them you get another turn. 
If in this case the “Joker” is on top of the stack, you are allowed to throw any card on the stack no matter the rank or the suit
10.	You are allowed to end with a “pest” card.

“Pest” cards: rank 0/ “Joker”, rank 1/ “Ace”, rank 2, rank 7, and rank 8
